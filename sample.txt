        "to 3% deficit as a percent of GDP you&amp;#39;re",
        "like wait a second does this do enough",
        "and the tax cuts are 4.5 trillion over",
        "10 years so you know it&amp;#39;s approximately",
        "450 billion a year if you&amp;#39;re trying to",
        "catch up how are we doing tax cuts but",
        "Jal remember you can&amp;#39;t make those",
        "statements as fact because a lot of",

        "grow faster than this particular the CBO",
        "economists will estimate the CBO",
        "economists are trying to be conservative",
        "so there&amp;#39;s a whole lot of debate going",
        "on right now on like how much is this",
        "really going to cost and people like oh",
        "my God Trump is talking about raising",
        "our deficit so much over the next decade",
        "but then there&amp;#39;s a different point of",
        "view which is wait a second if you",
        "assume that the economy will grow",
        "because of these Cuts then that&amp;#39;s",
        "actually not true and then there&amp;#39;s all",

        "trillion dollars of Revenue or no knows",
        "it&amp;#39;s just a negotiating position just a",
        "negoti so no one knows yeah no one knows",
        "so that that&amp;#39;s my I think main point is",
        "this uh this Administration is all over",
        "the place you know and the cuts are",
        "great but&amp;#39;s right the B market tells you",
        "a lot the fact that the has the 10 year",
        "was was peaked at 5% two two weeks",
        "before the election and then it peaked",
        "again the second week of January at",
        "4.78% now it&amp;#39;s down to 4.26% today so",
        "it&amp;#39;s come down by a full half a point in",

        "about the expectations on inflation and",
        "growth over the next decade and it&amp;#39;s",
